# VRWikiProj
Summer 2019 School Project Wiki
Put each page's.html file in a separate folder named according to the topic.

Be sure to name the .html files accordingly:

/home/index.html
/History/History.html
/Future/Future.html
/PCHardware/PCHardware.html
/Console-mobile/Console-mobile.html
/PCHeadsets/PCHeadsets.html
/MoblieHeadsets/Mobileheadsets.html
/BusinessVR/BusinessVR.html
/VRMedia/VRMedia.html



Be sure to include any necessary files e.g. any images and other media.

Try to keep imgs in decent quality, but make sure they're .jpg or .pngs to keep file size low.
