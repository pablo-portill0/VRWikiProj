The future in the field of entertainment for virtual reality is seemingly limitless. New innovations are being introduced every day in order to increase our VR experience and entertainment value. Itâ€™s obvious that we will continue to see the usual improvements, through size as the headsets become smaller, through comfort as they become more lightweight and ergonomic, and through portability as we start to see less hardware required and more wireless options.<br>
There are countless other ways that we will see improvements as well. As they become more convenient and lightweight, they will also become more stylish. We will also see improvements to sound quality, resolution, and color. The virtual world will become so much more immersive and will be able to take us away from that long plane ride, that dentist chair, or that hospital bed. We are moving towards complete immersion as the top researchers in the field make new breakthroughs almost daily.<br>
No longer will we have to leave the comfort of our homes for the expensive and sometimes undesirable movie theaters to watch IMAX films, as VR will one day replicate the IMAX experience in our living rooms. No more paying for tickets for that concert you really want to see, as VR will eventually be able to show you the concert live as if you were there. Rollercoasters are a popular subject when it comes to VR, as many have been recreated for us to see on the headset. However, instead of being able to ride the roller coaster, imagine being able to visit the entire theme park.<br>
The VR market is looking to grow to $45 billion dollars in 2024. Experts are predicting this boom in the VR market to happen soon, as costs for the sets are declining while the technology is getting better. Right now, you may not know many people if any that own a VR headset. Right now, the only people to own high end sets are the early adopters, paying large sums of money to experience the new technology. The main factor in moving from the early adopter stage is pricing, and we are set to see price declines in high end VR technology. Expect to also see an influx of companies offering VR products, as well as brand new startups getting into the mix as well. As this overflow of competition begins, we will start to see new innovation, better technology, and more major price drops.
