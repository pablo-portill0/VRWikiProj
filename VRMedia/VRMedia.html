                From its inception, Virtual Reality has been used for media, from attempts at 3D effects in movies, to new 360-degree short films; and with growing demand for VR, more and VR-oriented content is being produced. As the IDC predicts, VR and AR shipments are expected to increase by over 1.5 million units, to 7.6 million units shipped in 2019 (Mott, 2019). Demand like this shows, when It comes to the media that usually sells right alongside the hardware.

                Best-selling game Superhot (2016) recently was overtaken by its VR-oriented sibling Superhot VR (2017), with the latter selling over 800,000 units (Hayden, 2019b). The VR title is currently ranked as a “Platinum” game on Steam, putting the game alongside other best-sellers like Beat Saber, which also set its own records, shipping over one million copies as of March 2019 (Hayden,2019a). The developers Superhot Team attribute part of their VR success to the 2018 holiday season, which may also be partly due to Beat Saber having their initial release on PlayStation VR on November 20th of 2018.

                This comes as the developers had reservations about the strength of the VR market, expecting Superhot VR to, “not [be] impactful at all, because VR was very, very small, basically, at that point,” Tomasz Kaczmarczyk told MIXED, a German VR publication (Hayden, 2019b). A similar story came from Beat Games’ Jaroslav Beck, one of the developers of Beat Saber, “…guys from the industry who we spoke with [including advisors and long-time industry professionals] told us we’re freaks if you think we can get this number” (Hayden, 2019a). Nevertheless, these games maintain their places at the top of the VR charts, partly due to the constant influx of new VR owners.

                Alongside new VR only games, older games are seeing new life as VR enabled titles like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR (2018) or Fallout 4 VR (2017). Recently, No Man’s Sky (2016), just announced a new VR update to the game, a welcome improvement after a particularly rocky launch.

                Besides videogames, there are various new forms of VR content available, with some major players getting onboard to serve this new content. To begin, Wescover, a service that helps you discover art and its creators’ ideas about them, has partnered with Google Lens, AR app which gives helps users search by simply taking pictures of things (Jaehnig, 2019). With this partnership, Wescover hopes to provide a frictionless experience to users of Google Lens, by instantly giving users info on the artist and leading to the Wescover site for other works in the area. Wescover is slowly publishing their content onto Google Lens, starting with a special experience, mapping San Franciscan Art and making use of Google Lens for the info behind the works.

                In more traditional media, Amazon is making inroads by getting their Prime Video on the newest Oculus headsets (Oculus VR, 2019). Amazon is touting the ability for users to simulate their own personal theater to watch traditional 2D Prime Originals like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Good Omens, and Oscar-nominated Cold War. Amazon is also adding true 360-degree content, hosting Emmy-nominated short film Invasion! and documentary Greenland Melting, a film from NOVA and Frontline about climate change’s effect on the artic island.
