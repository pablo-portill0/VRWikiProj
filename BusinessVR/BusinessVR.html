                As Virtual Reality (VR) begins maturing as a technology, we can see a clear growth in consumer adoption; an unexpected element, however, is how much commercial sources are contributing to the rise in VR adoption. According to the IDC, VR and Augmented Reality (AR) headset shipments rose 27.2% year over year in Q1 2019 (Mott, 2019). Furthermore, the IDC expects global shipments to reach 7.6 million units in 2019, up from 5.9 million in 2018, with most of the growth coming from commercial, rather than consumer, demand.

                While UPS uses VR to train their drivers, Wal-Mart is using VR to help train all their associates. In 2017, Wal-Mart started using VR at it’s 220 Walmart Academies around the US (Morris, 2018). Those were tethered headsets, so they had to be used in-location, but with the advent of new standalone headsets, Wal-Mart is starting a rollout of its VR training program by sending more than 17,000 to over 4,600 stores across the US, helping employees learn new procedures and tech, from learning disaster preparedness to handling Black Friday. Along with roll out of VR to its training facilities, the retail giant observed a 10 to 15% increase in test scores by its students.

                The Boeing company is also adopting VR technology, by using AR tech to help its electrical technicians wire their aircraft (The Boeing Company, 2018). With AR, they can super-impose a 3-D model of the aircraft’s wiring diagram and access instructions, all hands-free. Since starting testing, they have observed a 90% improvement in first time quality and a 30% reduction in time spend on a job. Other companies like JetBlue, United Rentals, Fidelity Investments, and Tyson Foods credit training and performance improvements to VR (Morris, 2018).

                Besides corporate adoption, there is also large investment in VR from the US military. As far back as 2015, The Office of Naval Research (ONR) opened the Battlespace Exploitation of Mixed Reality (BEMR) Lab at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) (Smalley, 2015). Focused on ‘Mixed Reality’ the facility specializes on using a mix of VR and AR for training, with the benefit of being able to actively switch between virtualization levels on-the-fly.

                Besides BEMR, the Navy uses VR for recruiting, touring with the ‘Nimitz’, a specially designed mobile VR experience that features a combat experience, powered by Oculus Rift headsets and “Sub-Pacs” – wearable subwoofers that add a sense of physicality to the experience (Chang, 2018). The Nimitz has helped boost recruitment leads by 48% when stationed at the 2017 Winter X Games, and by over 126% when stationed at an Army/Navy football game, a case study by Virtual Reality Marketing found.

                One of the more surprising VR uses is also in the healthcare world, from Virtual reality trainings, to helping surgeons and patients alike explore patient physiology. To begin, in 2018, a collaboration between Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and GIBLIB, a streaming platform specializing in surgical content, created the first accredited surgical virtual reality course (Nichols, 2018). Using several different views, from 360-dgeree views of operating theaters, to direct surgeon field of views, to direct laparoscopic views, the module helps students learn “advanced techniques and procedures and ultimately, deliver excellent care to patients across the country,” says Harry Sax, MD, the executive vice chair of the Cedars-Sinai Department of Surgery.

                Virtual reality is also being adopted as a tool for both patients and surgeons alike, to explore their pathologies in closer detail. The Children’s National Health System in Washington DC was the first east coast hospital to adopt a system by Surgical Theater, a leader in the healthcare VR space (Badat, 2018). Dubbed the Virtual Reality Visualization platform, the system presents a powerful way to visualize patient-specific anatomy, combining medical scans together to create a 360-degree virtual reconstruction of a patient’s anatomy. While helping inform a surgeon’s decisions, the system is also a boon in helping patients understand their condition by helping visualize their condition, along with the options for surgical approaches.
