                Tethered virtual reality headsets, also known as desktop VR or PC VR headsets, require a constant connection to a powerful computer and often make use of external sensors or cameras to track the user's position. This helps provide users with high-quality immersion in a virtual environment but, in return, demands a certain amount of setup space (sometimes even a dedicated room) as well as a powerful PC configuration. We detail some of these technical considerations towards the end of this article.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Thanks to a growing public interest for VR and massive investment from giant tech companies, more and more tethered HMDs are available on the market. As it can be challenging to search through this booming market, the goal of this page is to give new users insight on popular brands.

    <p class="content">Sony's PlayStation VR headset, commonly known as the PS VR headset, works with PS4 gaming consoles. Its 110 degree FOV OLED display is supported by quite a good refresh rate of 120 Hz, an important spec that may prevent VR motion sickness for some users.

    <p class="content">The HTC VIVE Pro is among the most expensive HMDs on the market. In comparison with the HTC VIVE, the Pro offers a 78% increase in screen resolution, more comfort, and other additional features.

    <p class="content">
        Oculus started out as a Kickstarter campaign back in 2012. Today, the Oculus Rift is one of the top gaming VR headset contenders in the industry. We enjoyed playing with the Rift, although we did feel some pressure on the face and ended up with typical VR faces (our cheeks and foreheads were left with marks for a few hours).
    </p>
​
    <p class="content">
        Pros:
        <br>
        Comes with two 6DoF controllers and two sensors

        <p class="content">
            The HMD Odyssey is a Windows Mixed Reality headset from Samsung, South Korea's tech giant. To be clear, this headset is compatible with virtual reality, and not mixed reality (Windows' Mixed Reality content platform name can be misleading). This VR headset is quick and easy to install, as it doesn't require any external sensors or cameras to detect its position. The Odyssey boasts AMOLED displays, contrary to most of its Windows MR counterparts that feature LCD screens.
        </p>
​
        <p class="content">
            Pros:
            <br>

            Built-in microphones and headphones
