<p>A standalone VR headset is a headset that can work without being tethered to a computer. Tethered headsets (Oculus, HTC Vive, PSVR, Windows Mixed Reality headsets) needs to be connected to a computer/game-console to function. ... However due to mobility, standalone headsets are less powerful.</p>
<p>There are currently nowhere near as many untethered VR headsets available in the burgeoning virtual reality market, compared to PC VR (tethered VR) and smartphone VR.</p>
​
<p>Tethered VR/AR HMDs must be connected by cable to a PC, harnessing the powerful processing power of the hardware in the connected PC or console. However, mobile VR headsets use the more widely accessible and available smartphones to deliver less advanced VR.</p>
​
<p>Standalone virtual reality headsets (a.k.a. untethered, wireless, standalone VR) don't require a PC or a smartphone to deliver a VR experience. The self-contained headsets (made popular by releases such as the Oculus Go) include built-in processors, GPU, sensors, battery, memory, displays, and more. In addition, as these VR goggles are uncabled, users don't have to limit themselves to a restricted space. In general, they offer a more powerful VR experience than smartphone VR but less powerful than tethered VR.</p>

    <h1>DPVR M2P RO</h1>
    <p>DPVR (or Deepoon) has a few VR products available, however, this is the only standalone VR headset available from the manufacturer. One of the features is the ability to relatively quickly recharge the VR HMD. Although it has a high price-point, it doesn't offer the same high specs as other all-in-one headsets available. Furthermore, no controllers are available.</p>
​
<p>Pros:
​
Low latency
Quick battery recharge</p>
<p>
Cons:
​
No controllers
Less affordable than most products in this VR category</p>

    <h1>GenBasic Quad HD</h1>
    <p>This untethered VR was one of the first HMDs in the category to be released, and it has good specs considering. With 110 degrees FOV, a decent refresh rate of 75Hz and the standalone VR is compatible with a variety of OS. However, due to the age of the device, it is the least future-proofed and user feedback was negative on the comfort and content available.</p>
<p>
Pros:
​
Affordable price-point
Runs on multiple OS</p>
<p>
Cons:
​
Dated technology
Poor comfort and wearability
Bad ventilation and can overheat</p>

            <h1>HTCViveFocus</h1>
    <p>The VIVE FOCUS is one of the few standalone VR headsets to have 6DoF (6 Degrees of Freedom), hence the much higher price-point. However, this HMD does offer a range of features such as additional 2TB storage, basic gesture tracking, and longer battery life compared to other devices in this category.</p>
​
<p>Pros:
​
Built-in microphone and speakers
Ongoing software updates for improvements
6DoF</p>
<p>
Cons:
​
High price-point</p>

            <h1>Lenovo Mirage Solo</h1>
    <p>This standalone VR headset is not as affordable as other options on our list, but it has better specs compared to some of the other HMDs available. The Mirage Solo offers a more immersive VR experience than other VR headsets lacking 6DoF. On the downside is the heavy, large design making is less portable for users.</p>
​
<p>Pros:
​
Great storage and memory options
High accuracy of positional tracking
Long battery life</p>
​
<p>Cons:
​
Bulky design, heavy and uncomfortable to wear & not ideal for portability
Lacks built-in speakers
A shortfall in great content</p>

            <h1>Oculus GO</h1>
    <p>The Oculus Go is arguably the most well-known example of standalone VR, therefore it is credited with increasing the visibility of VR in the mass market. The HMD is very easy to use and the plug and play setup caters for beginners and experienced users. The Oculus Go provides accessible VR of very good quality at this price-point.</p>
​
<p>Pros:
​
Affordable all-in-one VR
Comfortable design and fit
Large range of content available</p>
​
<p>Cons:
​
Only 3DoF
Basic controller
Long recharge time</p>
